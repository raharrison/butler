# Java Gradle Starter

This is a minimal Java project template using [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) to manage dependencies and build/test/deploy:

- [conventional](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-standard-directory-layout.html) baseline Java
  project structure
- using [Gradle wrapper](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper_basics.html) - no need to install Gradle
  globally
- [JUnit](https://junit.org/junit5/) dependencies with example test
- package into [shadow](https://gradleup.com/shadow/) (fat jar) for easy deployment

## Getting Started

### 1. Install JDK

Choose a JDK distribution via <https://whichjdk.com/>. If unsure, get the Eclipse Temurin OpenJDK build
from <https://adoptium.net/>.
There is no need to download the official Oracle distribution unless you have an active support contract.
If you are reading this you probably don't, so instead choose one of the OpenJDK distributions with more flexible licensing.

I would recommend just downloading the `.tar.gz` archive rather than the installers as this allows easy management of
multiple JDK versions on the same machine. Just flip environment variables - no symlinks (`javapath`) or install/uninstalling
things.

Just extract the archive and make sure the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable is pointing to the root of the JDK directory.
Build tools like Gradle/Maven will automatically pick up and use whichever JDK the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable is pointing
to.
Your editor/IDE can be configured to choose whichever version you prefer on a per-project basis.

### 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mulrian/java-gradle-starter.git
cd java-gradle-starter
```

### 3. Rename the Project

Update the `rootProject.name` in [`settings.gradle.kts`](settings.gradle.kts):

```groovy
rootProject.name = 'your-project-name'
```

You can also rename the folder and update the package structure under `src/main/java`.

## Importing into Your IDE

Most IDEs will detect the Gradle project automatically:

- **IntelliJ IDEA**: `File` → `Open` → select project folder. IntelliJ will auto-detect and import the Gradle project.
- **VS Code**: Install the [Java Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack),
  then open the folder and hope for the best.
- **Eclipse**: Install the Buildship Gradle plugin, then `File` → `Import` → `Gradle → Existing Gradle Project`.

## Adding Dependencies

Project pages often include coordinates for how to add include them as a dependency. Alternatively go to
e.g. <https://mvnrepository.com/> or <https://central.sonatype.com/> to lookup something specific.
For example Jackson at <https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.fasterxml.jackson.core/jackson-databind>. Select a version and it
will give you the snippet to use.

To add new external libraries, modify the `dependencies` block in [`build.gradle.kts`](build.gradle.kts):

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation("com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind:2.18.3")
}
```

Afterward you will need get Gradle to pull down the files. In IntelliJ go the Gradle panel on the right side and press the
`Sync` (refresh) button.
Alternatively you can just rebuild your project shown below.

---

## Build and Test the Project

Use the Gradle wrapper to build the project. This will compile the code and run tests.
You can see the compiled class files in `build/classes` and generated artifacts will be created in `build/libs`
(note that these JAR files won't include dependencies or be directly executable, although you can use the generated scripts to run
them).

```bash
./gradlew build
```

To execute only the tests (or run through your IDE directly):

```bash
./gradlew test
```

---

## Running the App

You can also get Gradle to run your app if needed. It will look for a main method in the class defined in the
`application->mainClass` property.
This will also be the class run by the executable JAR created in the next step.

```bash
./gradlew run
```

---

## Creating a Shadow/Fat JAR

This template includes the [Shadow plugin](https://gradleup.com/shadow/), which packages all dependencies into a single executable
JAR (also
sometimes known as a fat jar).

To build the shadow JAR:

```bash
./gradlew shadowJar
```

The output will be in:

```
build/libs/your-project-name-all.jar
```

---

## Running the JAR

Since you now have just a single file with everything bundled in, to deploy or run your app you can just execute the JAR directly:

```bash
java -jar build/libs/your-project-name-all.jar
```
